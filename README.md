The used car market is rapidly expanding due to increasing vehicle ownership and the demand
for affordable mobility solutions. Determining a fair resale value is challenging since it depends
on multiple factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and market
demand. Traditional pricing methods often rely on dealer judgment or manual inspection, which
leads to inconsistencies and a lack of transparency. This project, titled “Forecasting Used Car
Price Prediction using Machine Learning Approach,” focuses on building a predictive model
that estimates the resale value of pre-owned cars using real-world data from CarDekho. The
dataset includes attributes such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, seats, fuel type, transmission, and selling price. The methodology involved data preprocessing to clean and standardize the dataset, followed by
feature engineering to create meaningful attributes like car age and price per kilometer. After
experimenting with several algorithms, the Gradient Boosting Regressor was selected for its
superior accuracy in capturing non-linear patterns, achieving an R² of 0.87 with acceptable error
margins. To ensure usability, the model was deployed through an interactive Streamlit-based
dashboard, enabling users to filter cars, analyze trends, compare models, and predict resale prices
instantly. Overall, this project delivers a scalable, user-friendly system that enhances
transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the used car resale market, while laying the foundation
for future improvements such as deep learning, real-time APIs, and location-based
personalization.
